I'm a freelance software developer based in Belgium.

During 20+ years of development, I programmed in multiple languages. The most noteworthy are
Java, Groovy, JavaScript and (my favorite) Python.

My current focus is on fullstack applications with a React frontend and a Python serverless backend deployed on AWS.

I recently open sourced the [pyprojectx](https://github.com/houbie/pyprojectx) Python library
that makes it easier to get started with a Python project.
